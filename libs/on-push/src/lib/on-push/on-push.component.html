  <p>
    On push provides the possibility to skip unnecessary checks for this
    component and all it's child components
  </p>
  <p>
    Works by detecting if some new data has been explicitly pushed into the
    component, either via a component input or an Observable subscribed to using
    the async pipe
  </p>
  <p>Angular knows that the component only needs to be updated if:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the input reference has changed</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Primitives are passed by value</li>
      <li>
        Object and arrays are also passed by value but modifying object
        properties or array entries does not create a new reference and
        therefore does not trigger change detection
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>the component or one of its children triggers an event handler</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Be aware a rxJs subscribe doesn't trigger a change</li>
    </ul>
    <li>change detection is triggered manually</li>
    <li>
      an observable linked to the template via the async pipe emits a new value
      (internally markForCheck is called)
    </li>
  </ul>
