    This default strategy checks every component in the component tree from top
    to bottom every time an event triggers change detection (like user event,
    timer, XHR and so on). This conservative way of checking without making any
    assumption on the component's dependencies is called dirty checking
  </p>
  <p>
    Angular is very fast doing change detection for every single component as it
    can perform thousands of checks during milliseconds using inline-caching
    which produces VM-optimized code
  </p>
  <p>
    Although Angular does a lot of optimizations behind the scenes the
    performance can still drop on larger applications
